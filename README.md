# privacode
The *PrivaCode* library masks sensitive data by obscuring specific parts of strings or JSON data according to defined settings, such as minimum length, visible characters at the beginning or end, and the masking character or string. It is fully compatible with JSON data structures for streamlined data protection in JSON-based applications.
